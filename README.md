# Motivation
Research repo to explore possibilities of Microsoft's AutoGen framework.

I believe the agentic approach to application development is the future of software engineering.

LLM performance tends to decay when given more complicated tasks. To combat this the agentic approach decomposes the task into its smallest parts and assigns each task to an AI Agent that is prompted to be an expert at accomplishing that specific task. The power of agents is harnessed by using multiple agents, "experts" in their individual tasks, together to accomplish a much larger and more complex task.

# Repo Organization
I have separated my approach into a folder of agents taht I am able to put together into group chats to accomplish different high level tasks. I will need to iterate the individual prompts and collection of agents I use to tackle a specific problem.
